          <li>Elements in the body element contain structure based on the type of element. This line of text is a list item (li) inside of an unordered list (ul) in side of a section.</li>

        <h2>GIT</h2>
        <ul>
          <li>The code housed in GitHub is organized into repositories</li>
          <li>When working on code, we don't work directly on the main "branch" of the repository. Instead, we create our own branch, in which we can work without getting in our teammates' way. This branching structure enables teams to be working on several features at once without conflicting.</li>
          <li>Here are some often-used git commands entered on the command line:
            <ul>
              <li>git status: checks what branch we are currently on</li>
              <li>git checkout -b [branch-name]: creates a new branch and switches to it</li>
              <li>git add -A: stages all the edited (or newly added) files to be ready for a commit</li>
              <li>git commit -m "[commit notes]": commits all staged files to the current branch, and includes the given notes</li>
              <li>git pull origin main: pulls down any changes that have been made to the main branch, and updates your working branch to reflect them</li>
              <li>git push origin [branch-name]: pushes your updated local copy of your working branch up to GitHub</li>
            </ul>
            <li>After our work on a branch is complete, we file a "Pull Request". A Pull request is a process whereby your code changes can be viewed by other team members and approved, before being merged into the main branch.</li>
          </li>

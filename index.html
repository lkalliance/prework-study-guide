        <ul>
          <li>The head element contains information about the webpage.</li>
          <li>The body element contains the visible content of the webpage.</li>
          <li>HTML is a semantic language: many elements in an HTML docutment are named for what kind of content they contain.</li>
          <li>Elements in the head element are meta-data that is mostly invisible to the user.</li>
          <li>Elements in the body element contain structure based on the type of element. This line of text is a list item (li) inside of an unordered list (ul) in side of a section.</li>

        <h2>CSS</h2>
        <ul>
          <li>CSS rules are made up of selectors (what elements are to be styled) and declarations (properties to be styled, and values for those properties).</li>
          <li>We can identify our selectors either by listing a simple element type (all elements of that type are affected) or by listing a class (all elements with that class applied are affected).</li>
          <li>Some CSS properties that we can style include:
            <ul>
              <li>margin: the amount of space kept empty around the outside of the element (can be specified uniquely for each side of the element's box)</li>
              <li>padding: the amount of space kept empty around the inside of the border of the element (can be specified uniquely for each side of the element's box)</li>
              <li>border: the edges of the element (can be specified uniquely for each side of the element's box)</li>
              <li>width and height: the size of the element</li>
              <li>color and background-color: color of the element's text or its background</li>
              <li>font-size: the size of text in the element</li>
              <li>text-align: justification of text within an element</li>
              <li>display: the positioning of the element with relation to the flow of content</li>

        <h2>GIT</h2>
        <ul>
          <li>The code housed in GitHub is organized into repositories.</li>
          <li>When working on code, we don't work directly on the main "branch" of the repository. Instead, we create our own branch, in which we can work without getting in our teammates' way. This branching structure enables teams to be working on several features at once without conflicting.</li>
          <li>Here are some often-used git commands entered on the command line:
            <ul>
              <li>git status: checks what branch we are currently on</li>
              <li>git checkout -b [branch-name]: creates a new branch and switches to it</li>
              <li>git add -A: stages all the edited (or newly added) files to be ready for a commit</li>
              <li>git commit -m "[commit notes]": commits all staged files to the current branch, and includes the given notes</li>
              <li>git pull origin main: pulls down any changes that have been made to the main branch, and updates your local branch to reflect them</li>
              <li>git push origin [branch-name]: pushes your updated local copy of your working branch up to GitHub</li>
            </ul>
            <li>After our work on a branch is complete, we file a "Pull Request". A Pull request is a process whereby your code changes can be viewed by other team members and approved, before being merged into the main branch.</li>
          </li>

        <ul>
          <li>A variable is a container that allows us to store data in our code</li>
          <li>Control flow is the order in which a computer executes code in a script. We can manage the control flow using conditionals like if statements, or with loops like for statements.</li>
          <li>An array is a special kind of variable that contains multiple pieces of data. Each piece of data has an index, starting with 0, and we can access each piece of data by referencing the array name follwed by [index number].</li>
          <li>A function is a block of code we can define that will not execute unless we call it elsewhere in the code. This way, we can execute the code block many times without having to rewrite it each time.</li>
